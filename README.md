# FutureGuys
a dwarf fortress mod

This mod is a dwarf fortress futurism mod and a scenario/challenge

the theme of the mod is that the goblins escaped from their demon rulers and chilled out a bit. a different race decided to warship the demons and are now a threat to the
goblins, the dwarves and the elves.

the primary weapons are guns, there is a lua script which is activated to allow shotguns to have buckshot and assult rifles to shoot rapidly. the armor is as follows:

Leather and steel plates(as strong as copper, it will be exclusivly used by the bad guy race)
kevlar and leather(as strong as bronze, it is the easiest to make as this mod uses the more leather mod)
kevlar and steel plates(as stron as iron, steel is easy to come by and kevlar is harder to make)
pure kevlar(as strong as steel)
special armor(currently both adamantine adn orichalcum are present, i am very interested in rebranding and using just one special metal, it is a left over from my goblin
mod)

#there are no humans, try as I could I could not think of an intersting gimmick for them.

elves no longer care about your fortresses tree choppping habits and have decided that digging in to the earth is good for you.

elves still need to be primarily above ground, they get sick from being underground. they can grow infinate wood which incentivizes above ground bases. they have access
to exotic animals, many of these animals need to be forced in to use by them by using the Animal tag as it is used for kobolds which bind them to an aniaml class
[ANIMAL]
		[ANIMAL_CLASS:POISONOUS]
		[ANIMAL_FORBIDDEN_CLASS:MAMMAL]
		[ANIMAL_NEVER_MOUNT]
		[ANIMAL_NEVER_WAGON_PULLER]
		[ANIMAL_NEVER_PACK_ANIMAL]
		[ANIMAL_ALWAYS_PET]
		[ANIMAL_ALWAYS_SIEGE]
   
They can trun their wood in to a metal like wood which is essentially steel. they make guns and armor out of this substance, they also have access to kevlar. they
will probably be the easiest race to get started with

goblins are a mix of above and below ground, they can turn bars of metal in to 15 sheet metal which is used for construction. this incentivizes above ground fortresses
just for fun and becuase its easier than in vanilla.

they use other sentient races such as trolls and gremlins. trolls are naturally skilled laborers and handle all of the mining, farming and crafting leaving the
soldiering and metal working to their smarter friends(not owners, this is not to be seen as slavery, just diversity) the goblins

gremlins are goofy little dudes who are good bards and have a knack for sharp shooting. they are extremely frail though

dwarves are essentailly as we all know and love them, they dig forts and shoot guns. their specialy is their robots. the robots will handle the mining, farming and what
ever else as well as military services. robots are made from bronze metal, any type of mechanisms and gold for wiring. they still need to be implemented.
